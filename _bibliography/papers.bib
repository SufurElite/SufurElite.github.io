  abstract={This paper identifies the system used for my submission to EvaLatin's shared dependency parsing task as part of the LT4HALA 2024 workshop. EvaLatin presented new Latin prose and poetry dependency test data from potentially different time periods, and imposed no restriction on training data or model selection for the task. This paper, therefore, sought to build a general Latin dependency parser that would perform accurately regardless of the Latin age to which the test data belongs. To train a general parser, all of the available Universal Dependencies treebanks were used, but in order to address the changes in the Latin language over time, this paper introduces historical sentence embeddings. A model was trained to encode sentences of the same Latin age into vectors of high cosine similarity, which are referred to as historical sentence embeddings. The system introduces these historical sentence embeddings into a biaffine dependency parser with the hopes of enabling training across the Latin treebanks in a more efficacious manner, but their inclusion shows no improvement over the base model.},

  author={Rufus Behr},

  month={December},
  abstract={Due to the unique challenges presented by low-resource languages compared to their high resource counterparts, common tasks concerning the style of low-resource language text may require less straightforward approaches. To explore the validity of this claim, this paper investigates authorship attribution, also known as author classification, a common stylometric-based task, in a low-resource language setting â€” namely, Latin. In doing so, it sheds light on potential useful features for subsequent stylometric tasks for Latin},
