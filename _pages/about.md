I am a Research Software Engineer at Northeastern University and a recent graduate from the University of Aberdeen with a degree in Computing Science and Mathematics &ndash; formerly, a Data Science Intern at ReSource Pro and Full Stack & Cloud Summer Analyst at Goldman Sachs.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and competing in Chess & Bridge; studying languages, mathematics, and their intersection; and watching cycling races.
